            Need help with your Computer Science team project? Not sure how to get your project done? Don't have any project ideas?<br><br>

You're in the right place. We, Broken Code are a team of Computer Science students and techies who can help you in your team project from first to last. From the project topic to the project report, everything is covered. We'll take courses on the topic and make sure all of your team members are completely aware of the project. We solve all doubts about the project. We provide Google Meet calls and screen-record videos about the project.<br><br>

<b>Why Us?</b><br><br>

Thanks for asking. We completed a lot of projects and successfully presented them for us and others using different technologies from websites to mobile apps. So, computer science projects are the things we always think about and talk about. We already mentored a lot of teams in their projects and helped them launch their projects from first to last. We can assure you that we are the people you'll be most comfortable communicating with and making this project possible for a minimum price. So, why not us?!
